Stop me if you've heard it all before girl
Stop me there'll be no more to say
I'd give you the world
If the world was mine to give
I would hold you dear
For as long as I live
Darling you and I
We could light up the world
An ordinary guy
With a wonderful girl
The richer we can be
Richer than a millionaire
We'd have everything
Money just couldn't buy
Fancy diamond rings
And a place in society
No but they don't mean a thing
So my life will get by
But stop me
If you've heard it all before girl
Stop me all you've got to do is say
If your love is still unsure love
Then stop me there'll be no more to say
There's no guarantee
That we'll find a pot of gold
But who can ever tell
Where that rainbow will end
Just put your trust in me
And together our love will grow
If that was not my word
You can always depend
But stop me
If you've heard it all before girl
Stop me all you've got to do is say
If your love is still unsure love
Then stop me there'll be no more to say
Stop me
If you've heard it all before girl
Stop me all you've got to do is say
If your love is still unsure love
Then stop me there'll be no more to say
There'll be no more to say
There'll be no more to say
There'll be no more to say
