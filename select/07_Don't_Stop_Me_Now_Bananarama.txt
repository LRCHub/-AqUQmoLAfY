There's a rumour going round
About the company you keep
Didn't want to believe it
But you been talking in your sleep

Now I know the reason
I heard you call her name
Well you made your bed
Better lie in it
Watch me walk away

Don't you try to stop me now
Don't you say you love me now
I don't wanna talk no more
'Cos I've heard it all before
Do I have to spell it out
Don't you know I've caught you out
So go on be free
But you won't see me anymore

Boy you're really something
Thought you had it made
Well I'm here to tell you
You've made a big mistake

Now I know the answer
So hear me when I say
Well you've had your fun
Not the only one
It's my turn to play

Don't you try to stop me now
Don't you say you love me now
I don't wanna talk no more
'Cos I've heard it all before
Do I have to spell it out
Don't you know I've caught you out
So go on be free
But you won't see me anymore

Now I know the reason
I heard you call her name
Well you made your bed
Better lie in it
Watch me walk away

Don't you try to stop me now
Don't you say you love me now
I don't wanna talk no more
'Cos I've heard it all before
Do I have to spell it out
Don't you know I've caught you out
So go on be free
But you won't see me anymore

Don't you try to stop me now
Don't you say you love me now
I don't wanna talk no more
'Cos I've heard it all before
Do I have to spell it out
Don't you know I've caught you out
So go on be free
But you won't see me anymore

Don't you try to stop me now
Don't you say you love me now
I don't wanna talk no more
'Cos I've heard it all before
Do I have to spell it out
Don't you know I've caught you out
So go on be free
But you won't see me anymore
