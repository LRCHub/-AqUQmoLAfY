You can have me caged in praying on my downfall
The game got me fucked up, got to fuck around y'all
Straight through, zoom like a Nascar

Visions, don't talk about decisions
I was the last one to get this
Kept my head up when the rain
I"m a lumberjack, I'm dropping
Trees to the game
Not talking about the plants
The criminals never safe
This came from the heart
Don't look at my past
I just left it in this dark
I could start from scratch
Multiply the truth, it's all facts
You can deny I'm great, you don't rap
If you something ain't real
From waiting at the bus stop
If God's real, why my friend have to die
Sometimes I've just got to ask why
Back-to-back, cars move after the fact
It's like my life action-packed
Memories just fade in, caved in
I wrote this already, it's like
But I will never stop my love
You can't infiltrate, one in a billion
Like Young Jeezy feeling like one in a million
I get the chance, I work harder than ever
Anybody talking down, bitch we in it together
You seem to forget, you not gonna live forever
Why you cop that ride and you spend that cheddar
Stack up your money, that's word to mother
Love of people talking down man
My life not made, I'm in the hood like antspray
Why he call his album that
And how the fuck he feel
Bitch I do what I want
And the tracks is ill
Remember Lil B, bitch
That's that dude that's real
